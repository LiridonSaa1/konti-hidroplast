### 2. Enhanced Form Interface
- Language-specific PDF upload sections with clear visual indicators
- Separate file upload components for each language
- Validation ensuring at least one file (image or PDF) is provided
- Support for both image and PDF files simultaneously

### 3. Improved Table Display
- New "PDF Languages" column showing available PDFs by language
- Visual indicators for each available language
- Clear distinction between legacy and language-specific PDFs

```sql
ALTER TABLE "certificates" ADD COLUMN "pdf_url_en" text;
ALTER TABLE "certificates" ADD COLUMN "pdf_url_mk" text;
ALTER TABLE "certificates" ADD COLUMN "pdf_url_de" text;
```

### Updated Constraints
